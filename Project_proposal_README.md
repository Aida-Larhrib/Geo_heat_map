# Project
Signals and systems python project: AÃ¯da Larhrib student 5854261. 
My project idea is to make geoheatmap. I would like to develop a tool that would be able to read coordinates (latittude and longitude) with corresponding temperatures and pollution levels and generate heatmaps. For that I would have evaluate first how much pollution influences temperature.
